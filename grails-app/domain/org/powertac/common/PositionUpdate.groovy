/**
 * A {@code PositionUpdate} domain instance represents a single position change
 * in a broker's depot / portfolio. Each update thus carries a {@code relativeChange}
 * that describes the concrete addition or subtraction of a certain product in a certain
 * timeslot as part of the respective position transaction as well as an
 * {@code overallBalance}, which represents the running total of the broker's position of
 * the product for the timeslot.
 *
 * To determine the total amount of a product a certain broker owns for a certain product
 * in a certain competition, one simply searches for the instance marked as {@code
 * latest=true} discriminating by competition, product, timeslot, and broker (this is an
 * indexed search and thus fast).
