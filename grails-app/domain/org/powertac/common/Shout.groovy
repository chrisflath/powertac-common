/**
 * A shout domain instance represents a market or a limit order in the PowerTAC wholesale
 * market. More precisely it represents a single state of this specific order. Each time a
 * change occurs, the shout object is cloned, the {@code latest} property is set to false
 * for the original object (which remains unchanged otherwise) and all necessary changes
 * are put into the newly cloned shout instance. Like this, each update (e.g. a partial
 * execution, a deletion by system or by user can be tracked by selecting all
 * shout instances from the database that carry the same {@code shoutId}, which is the
 * common identifier for all instances that belong to the same original shout (note that
 * this is not the {@code id} field, which is different (and unique) for each shout
 * instance and servers as primary key for the database.
 *
 * Note: The word "shout" was chosen to avoid db level incompatibilities due to the word
 * "order" being a reserved word in most SQL dialects.
