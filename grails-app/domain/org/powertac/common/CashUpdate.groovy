/**
 * A {@code CashUpdate} domain instance represents a single cash transaction
 * in a broker's cash account. Each update thus carries a {@code relativeChange}
 * that describes the concrete addition or subtraction of money as part of the
 * respective cash transaction as well as an {@code overallBalance}, which represents
 * the running total of the broker's cash account.
 *
 * To determine the total amount of cash a certain broker currently owns in a certain
 * competition, one simply searches for the instance marked as {@code
 * latest=true} discriminating by competition and broker (this is an
 * indexed search and thus fast).
