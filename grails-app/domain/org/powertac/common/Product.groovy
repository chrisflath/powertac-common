/**
 * A product instance describes a product that is tradeable in the powertac wholesale market.
 * Currently we only support Futures (see {@link ProductType}), which are binding energy
 * consumption or production commitments at a defined price for a particular {@link
 * Timeslot} sometimes in the future. In later versions of PowerTAC one might implement
 * Options as another product tradeable in the wholesale mareket, which grants the option
 * holder the right (but comes with no obligation) to consume or produce energy at a certain
 * price for a defined timeslot.
